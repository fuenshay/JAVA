1.1
What are hardware and software?
- The hardware of a computer comprises the visible physical elements of the
  computer, while software provides the invisible instructions that control
  the hardware and make it perform specific tasks.

1.2
List five major hardware components of a computer.
- A central processing unit (CPU)
  Memory (main memory)
  Storage devices (such as disks and CDs)
  Input devices (such as the mouse and keyboard)
  Output devices (such as monitors and printer)
  Communication devices (such as modems and network interface cards)

1.3
What does the acronym CPU stand for?
- Central Proccessing Unit // Coomputer's brain!

1.4
What is used to measure CPU speed?
- hertz(Hz) // gigahertz(Ghz) are mainly used today

1.5
What is a bit? What is a byte?
- Bits, or binary digits, are the 0s and 1s in the binary number system.
  A computer exists upon a series of switches which exist in two states,
  1 being on and 0 being off.
- A byte is a minimum storage unit in a 
  computer, composed of 8 bits.

1.6
What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why is memory called RAM?
- Memory is an ordered sequence of bytes which stores programs as well
  as data that the program is working with. A program and its data must
  be moved into the computer's memory before they can be executed by the
  CPU.
- RAM stands for Random Access Memory, because the bytes in the memory can
  be accessed in any order.

1.7
What unit is used to measure memory size?
- Kilobyte / 1 KB == 1,000 bytes
- Megabyte / 1 MB == ! miilion bytes
- Gigabyte / 1 GB == 1 billion byes
- Terabyte / 1 TB == 1 trillion bytes

1.8
What unit is used to measure disk size?
- Gigabytes and Terabytes

1.9
What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device?
- Whereas memory refers to the location of short-term data, storage is the
  component of your computer that allows you to store and access data on a
  long-term basis.
